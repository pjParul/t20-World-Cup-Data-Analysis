# t20-World-Cup-Data-Analysis

Objective:
Analyse statistics from the Cricket T20 World Cup (2022) to develop insights into a team with the best 11 players.

Description:
The 2022 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was the eighth ICC Men's T20 World Cup tournament. It was played in Australia from 16 October to 13 November 2022.
The twelve teams that reached the Super 12 phase of the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup automatically qualified for the 2022 tournament. Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, India, Pakistan, New Zealand and South Africa all qualified directly for the Super 12 phase of this tournament, based on their performances in the 2021 tournament and their rankings as of 15 November 2021. Namibia, Scotland, Sri Lanka and the West Indies were all placed in the group stage of the competition.

Steps taken to complete the project include:
•	Web Scrapping: 
  o	Use bright data Web Scrapping to collect data from Espncricinfo Website.
•	Data Preprocessing: 
  o	Data Cleaning on Jupyter Notebook - remove unnecessary data, adding desired columns, and mapping between tables in Pandas. 
  o	Create CSV files from all data text files.
•	Create Dashboard: 
  o	Into Power BI Desktop, export all data in CSV format.
  o	Additional data transformation and cleaning on Power BI Query Editor.
  o	In Model View, map the necessary columns.
  o	Add key measures for obtaining information quickly.
  o	Create attractive Dashboards by applying suitable parameters. 
  
How it is useful:
•	Use this to compile each player data:
  o	From which team they are,
  o	How many innings they have played,
  o	Runs scored in each innings,
  o	Batting style, batting average, total balls faced
•	Get top players for each category - openers, anchors, finishers, all-rounders, specialist fast bowlers.
•	Get a team of best 11 players.

Learnings from the Project:
•	Learn to collect Data and analyse it thoroughly
•	Extract required information from Dataset.
•	Learn about Python libraries, how to use them for Data Preprocessing.
•	Get insights of Power BI Desktop to create Dashboards.
•	Hands on Practice on Jupyter Notebook, Power BI Desktop, MS Excel
